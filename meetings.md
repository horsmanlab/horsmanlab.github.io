## Group Meeting Schedule
**Time:** Fridays 11:30-1:00 pm BA211<br/>


*Research presentations* - Provide an update on your research, starting with sufficient background to ensure everyone understands your project’s provenance and motivations. Finish with your proposed next steps as well as your longer-term vision for the project. This is also an excellent opportunity to harness the groups’ collective experience for feedback and troubleshooting. Plan your presentation for about 15-20 min in length.<br/>

*Literature or method presentations* - For *literature* discussion, please select a paper from the recent literature and provide enough background information for the topic you are presenting. Plan your presentation for around 15-20 min. At least two days before your presentation, email your selected paper to the group. Alternatively, you may wish to cover a lab technique or other *method* that would be useful for members to think about (e.g. HILIC, protein refolding, etc). In this case, please run your idea by me one week prior to your presentation.<br/>
