## Group Meeting Schedule
**Time:** Wednesday 1:00 pm via Zoom<br/>
*Status update* - The meeting will start with brief research updates from each team member (see below for format of Status Meetings), which should not last more than 15 min.<br/>

*Research presentations* - Provide an update on your research, starting with sufficient background to ensure everyone understands your project’s provenance and motivations. Finish with your proposed next steps as well as your longer-term vision for the project. This is also an excellent opportunity to harness the groups’ collective experience for feedback and troubleshooting. Plan your presentation for about 15-20 min in length.<br/>

*Literature presentations* - Please select a paper from the recent primary literature and provide enough background information for the topic you are presenting. Plan your presentation for around 15-20 min. At least two days before your presentation, email your selected paper to the group.<br/>

## Status Meetings
**Time:** Wednesday 1:00 pm via Zoom (15 minutes)<br/>
Status meetings are designed to be short updates to keep you on track. By stating your own weekly goals and then revisiting the following week as a group, it helps you understand realistic progress and holds you accountable. Each lab member will be expected to concisely answer the three following high-level questions:

(i) What have you done since the last status meeting?<br/>
(ii) What obstacles have you encountered?<br/>
(iii) What will you do before our next meeting?<br/>

For this to work, please adhere to the following guidelines: <br/>

- Craft a semester plan with your key research objectives for the semester (I can work with you on this if you like). ***Your weekly updates should be focused on your progress towards meeting these objectives and nothing else***. You don't have to prove to me that you are busy or working hard; progressing towards your goals is all that matters.<br/>
- Prepare ahead of time so that you can communicate clearly in 1-3 minutes. You shouldn't be looking things up during the meeting, everything should be ready and any visual aids prepared.
- Your answers to these questions should be at a high-level to address progress towards meeting your semester goals. If you need to discuss detailed technical issues we can schedule a separate meeting.
